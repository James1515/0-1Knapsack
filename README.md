# 0-1Knapsack


## Description:
An implementation of the 0-1 Knapsack Algorithm.


## Directions:
1. Compile Program:
g++ -std=c++11 knapsack.cpp -o knapsack

2. Main Driver:
The knapsack program is implemented useing Dynamic Programming
It is  set to the value W = 335732, n = 100, as well 
as the directions to fill the value and weight vector as per 
instructions for Assignment #3. 

3. Run Results:
The first display should be the Capacity W which is 335732
As well as the optimal knapsack size, followed by the 
list of vectors and their elements.
